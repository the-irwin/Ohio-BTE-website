                                    "Our mission is to fully recreate the entire Earth in Minecraft at a 1:1 scale. One block in Minecraft equates to roughly one meter in the real world, meaning that this project will fully recreate the size of our planet. Anyone is able to join us and contribute to the largest and most expansive build project to ever have been attempted in Minecraft. Every language, nationality, and regional difference is accepted and regarded as our greatest attribute as we continue our journey to unite all of Humanity's greatest achievements into a single Minecraft world."

All mods, configuration, and settings are preconfigured for convenience. Note that you must have an official copy of minecraft, since unofficial/cracked versions of Minecraft are not allowed in the project.

                            We expect this to take a few years at least, since Ohio is pretty big. However, we don't require builders to stick around from start to finish. We are flexible, and if you can only help for the next few months, we encourage you to come and help!
